#gr-spacebase - UHF Band Spectrum Sensing for vehicular communications
##Software radio approach to cataloguing TV white space for enabling vehicular communications.

This project will be updated over the coming weeks as the modules are built.

Current testing rig is an Ettus Research N210 with WBX daughterboard.

Project Aim : Test different spectrum sensing techinques for UHF channel white space detection  whilst the sensing equipment is travelling in a vehicle at speed.
